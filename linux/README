These packages supply an Iptables plugin and kernel module and that
allow rewriting of the destination IP address for IPv4 and IPv6.

iptables-daddr.EL   is for RHEL4 (IPv4 only).
iptables-daddr.el5  is for RHEL5.
iptables-daddr.el6  is for RHEL6.
iptables-daddr.fc17 is for Fedora 17.

To natively build all the packages for a given OS, change to the
directory for the OS desired then:

    $ make -f Makefile.native

Packages (RPMs) will be in:

    $ ls -l build-*/RPMS/* build-*-src/SRPMS


A practical application of this software is to do L3DSR (Level 3
Direct Server Return).  See Jan Schaumann's slides for an overview:
http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog51/presentations/Monday/NANOG51.Talk45.nanog51-Schaumann.pdf


For example, to use iptables-daddr you have two Load Balancers (LBs)
with two VIPs (e.g. 72.30.38.140 and 98.139.183.24) and several
servers behind them.  The LBs must be able to rewrite the DSCP field
of incoming, forwarded packets (or in some way mark the packets such
that an iptables match rule on the servers can identify them).

For example, the first VIP will set the DSCP field to 1 for its
packets going to the servers, where the second VIP will set the
DSCP field to 2.  This will allow the servers to know what to set
the destination address to in reply packets they send directly
to client machines.

On each server, create lookback interfaces corresponding to the VIPs
and iptables rules to set the return address on the packets:
# ifconfig lo:1 72.30.38.140 netmask 255.255.255.255
# ifconfig lo:2 98.139.183.24 netmask 255.255.255.255
# iptables -t mangle -A INPUT -m dscp --dscp 1 -j DADDR --set-daddr=72.30.38.140
# iptables -t mangle -A INPUT -m dscp --dscp 2 -j DADDR --set-daddr=98.139.183.24

An example for IPv6:
# ifconfig lo:3 add fc00:1000:0:6::10/128
# ifconfig lo:4 add fc00:1000:0:6::21/128
# ip6tables -t mangle -A INPUT -m dscp --dscp 10 -j DADDR --set-daddr=fc00:1000:0:6::10
# ip6tables -t mangle -A INPUT -m dscp --dscp 11 -j DADDR --set-daddr=fc00:1000:0:6::21
